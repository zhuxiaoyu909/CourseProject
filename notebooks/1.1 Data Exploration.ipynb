We have reviewed the NE (named entity) file, the CN (common noun) file, the V (verb) file and the P (preposition) file, and they all contained similar structure where there are multiple sets of 21 sentences, with the first 20 used for training and the 21 used as the prediction query. We will remove the 21st sentence in the next \"Data Cleansing\" section for the purpose of our project. We noticed the NE file contains less conversation specific and duplicate sentences compared to the other files, so we've chosen the NE train file for our project."
